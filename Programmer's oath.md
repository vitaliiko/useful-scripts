1. I will produce with each release a quick, sure and repeatable proof that every element of the code works as it should.
1. I will make frequent small releases, so I do not impede the prgress of others.
1. I will fearlessly and relentlessly improve my creations at every opportunity. I will never degrade them.
1. I will do all that I can to keep the productivity of myself and others as high as possible. I will do nothing that decreases the productivity.

1. I will produce estimates that are honest both in magnitude and precision. I will not make promises without certainty.
1. I will never stop learning and improving my craft.
